    "# Week 09: Word Sense Disambiguation\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we introduced a hot topic in Natural Language Proccessing: *Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)* .  \n",
    "Many words in natural languages have ambiguous meanings. For example, the word *[party](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/party)* can refer to 1) a social gathering (派對), 2) a political organization (政黨), or 3) an entity in law (當事人；⋯⋯方).  \n",
    "As a human, we can distinguish different meanings easily, but can a machine do the same? This is what WSD aims for.  "

    "You have to \n",
    "1. preprocess the data\n",
    "2. (stage 1) generate a small training dataset from the given collocation seed,\n",
    "3. (stage 1) train a weak model on that small dataset,\n",
    "4. (stage 2) use the weak model to generate more labeled data, and\n",
    "5. (stage 2) train your final model\n",
    "6. Evaluate your model on testing data (requirement: accuracy > 0.7)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Lesk's assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesk_algorithm), each word has only one sense when it appears in the same collocation.  \n",
    "For example, if *party* shows up with the word *court* (法庭), most likely the sense of this *party* is the 3rd one: an entity in law (當事人；⋯⋯方).  \n",
    "However, we are not implementing Lesk's algorithm this week. Instead, we will combine his assumption with [Yarowsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarowsky_algorithm) *bootstrap technique* .  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are given some pre-defined collocations, or called *seeds*, of the word *party*, along with which sense each collocation belongs to.  \n",
    "With the given seeds, you can generate a small set of labeled data by rule. Then with this small set, we can train a small model with limited accuracy.  \n",
    "The current classifier might not perform well on the whole dataset, sure, but it's already enough to generate more reliable labeled data. With the newly labeled training data, we can now train another sense-classification model with more robustness, which aims for the real WSD task.  \n",
    "This process, about training on smaller dataset, generating more data, and then improving the model itself, is called *[bootstrapping](https://www.mastersindatascience.org/learning/introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms/bootstrapping/)* .  \n"
