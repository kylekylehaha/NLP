    "# Week 14: Senquence Classification with BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment this week is to do the senquence classification. This may sound like what we had done in the previous assignment, but we are using BERT as our classifier this week, rather than Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to judge the CEFR level of a sentence.  \n",
    "[CEFR](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/cefr/) is a standard for describing language ability of a person. It consists of 6 levels, A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2, going from easier to harder.  \n",
    "A dataset that contains sentences with the corresponding CEFR level is provided, and you have to use BERT and train a sentence classifier with this dataset.  \n",
    "The dataset is collected and processed from a research by Alison Chi, 李書卉, 李冠霖 and Prof. Chang. Thank you all for allowing us to use it in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "As to the implementatin, we will introduce you the [🤗 transformers](https://huggingface.co/) library, which is mantained by huggingface company, as the training framework this week. [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) is used as the deep learning backend in this tutorial, but with the transformers library, all codes can be easily changed to tensorflow if you prefer so.  "
