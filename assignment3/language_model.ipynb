    "## What is a Language Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>A statistical language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given such a sequence, say of length $m$, it assigns a probability $P(w_1, \\ldots ,w_m)$ to the whole sequence.</b>\n",
    "<i>-- from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model\">Wikipedia</a></i>  \n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply, Language Model calculates the probability of a word, a sequence of words, or a sentence.  \n",
    "This can be useful in many NLP tasks, like machine translation, spelling checking, speech recognition, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following two sentence  \n",
    "\n",
    "> (1) He is looking <font color=\"green\">*to*</font> a new job.  \n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "> (2) He is looking <font color=\"green\">*for*</font> a new job.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that there's a grammar error in sentence 1, for which the LM should generate a lower probability.  \n",
    "Hence, if your LM is well-established, you are able to judge which sentence is more correct (or more common) among a set of candidate sentences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But how to do so?"
